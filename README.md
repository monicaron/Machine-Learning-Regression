# Machine-Learning-Regression
Regression using different algorithms from scratch- A house data consisting of features of houses and their price is used.
Here i have applied closed form approach and Gradient Descent Algorithm for optimiztion and then by using optimum coefficients,
price of test houses is predicted.
Error in the form of RSS is calculated between predicted and given price values.
